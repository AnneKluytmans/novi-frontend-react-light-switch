# ðŸ’¡ Light Switch App â€“ NOVI Frontend Module

This repository contains my solution for the Light Switch App exercise from the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).
The goal of this assignment is to practice working with **React State** and **conditional rendering** by building a simple interactive application that toggles a light on and off. 

The app demonstrates how to store and update state, apply conditional CSS styling, and dynamically change button text based on the current state.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (v18.2.0)
- **Vite**
- **HTML5**

## Key Features

- State management with React `useState` to store the light's status (on/off). 
- Button click handler toggling the light between on (`true`) and off (`false`). 
- Conditional styling:
  - Class `on` applied when the light is turned on. 
  - Class `off` applied when the light is turned off.
- Dynamic button text:
  - Displays **"Turn off"** if the light is on. 
  - Displays **"Turn on"** if the light is off.
- Real-time console logging to track state changes while interacting with the button.
